   -> Removal of empty spaces.
   -> tokenization (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-how-tokenizing-text-sentence-words-works/)
   -> stemming  (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-stemming-words-with-nltk/}
2) Classification
   ->Naive Bayes (https://www.javatpoint.com/machine-learning-naive-bayes-classifier)

3) Evaluation
   -> Calutaing accuracy and making a ***confusion matrix*** (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/)

The classification.ipyn depicts a simple classifier done on a dataset called Mushrooms.csv which classifies mushroom as poisonous and edible.
The Preeprocessing.ipybn depicts the process of pre-processing data.
The good/bad.ipynb is a simple model implement using nltk lib and naive bayes classifier to classify reviews as good or bad.
